### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-11 00:00]
  - **Task**: Document request helper functions
  - **Objective**: Clarify usage of helper constructors for OpenAI API requests
  - **Outcome**: Added Ddoc comments summarizing parameters and target endpoints

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - Prebuilt examples compiled successfully after changes

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Compiling each example manually is repetitive

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Provide a helper script to build all example projects in one step
