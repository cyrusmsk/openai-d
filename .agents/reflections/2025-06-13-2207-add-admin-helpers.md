### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-13 22:07]
  - **Task**: Add helper builders for administration requests
  - **Objective**: Provide convenience functions for constructing Administration API request structs
  - **Outcome**: Helpers implemented with tests and documentation updated

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - Reused patterns from existing modules to design builder functions quickly

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Local compilation of examples pulled dependencies again, increasing build time
  - Example: Local `dub build` in `examples/administration` took over a minute due to downloads

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Cache example build artifacts or dependencies to avoid repeated downloads during local builds
