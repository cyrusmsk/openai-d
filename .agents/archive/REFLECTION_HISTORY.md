### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-11]
  - **Task**: Replace new `OpenAIClient` style
  - **Objective**: Match README style across examples
  - **Outcome**: Updated every example to use `new OpenAIClient()` and verified formatting, linting, tests, coverage, and builds.

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - Tooling automated formatting and linting effectively.

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Building each example individually remains slow.

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement

### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-11]
  - **Task**: Document reflection log guidelines
  - **Objective**: Prevent duplicate dates and maintain chronological order
  - **Outcome**: Updated AGENTS.md with instructions to deduplicate and append history properly

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - Simple documentation change required minimal code adjustments

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Running linter downloads dependencies each time, slowing down checks

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Cache linter dependencies to speed up future runs

### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-11]
  - **Task**: Add example build script
  - **Objective**: Speed up building numerous example projects
  - **Outcome**: Created `scripts/build_examples.sh` with fast and all modes and documented its usage in AGENTS.md. Verified formatting, linting, tests, coverage and builds.

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - The helper script compiles selected examples with one command.

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Sequential example builds remain time-consuming and parallel builds caused dub cache conflicts.

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Investigate caching compiled dependencies or using `dub`'s built-in package cache to allow safe parallel builds.

### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-11]
  - **Task**: Cache Dub packages in CI
  - **Objective**: Speed up continuous integration by avoiding repeated downloads
  - **Outcome**: Added actions/cache steps to store `~/.dub/packages` on Linux and Windows

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - Workflow configuration was straightforward to extend

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Cross-platform paths for Dub packages required extra attention

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
- Document recommended cache paths for different operating systems

### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-12]
- **Task**: Make metadata optional in responses
- **Objective**: Ensure API structs support optional metadata fields
- **Outcome**: Added `@serdeOptional` attribute, updated formatting, linting, tests, coverage and example builds

### :sparkles: What went well
- Toolchain handled formatting and building examples reliably

### :warning: Pain points
- Coverage files clutter the repo root and are hard to review

### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
- Provide a script to summarize coverage results and clean up old lst files

### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-12]
- **Task**: Update environment variable handling
- **Objective**: Ensure OPENAI_API_BASE uses default URL when unset or empty
- **Outcome**: Changed configuration to use `environment.get(envApiBaseName, "")` and kept default fallback. Verified formatting, linting, tests, coverage and example builds.

#### :sparkles: What went well
- Tooling caught no issues after modification, making validation quick.

#### :warning: Pain points
- Coverage files clutter the project root and are easy to forget to clean.

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
- Automate cleanup of coverage artifacts after tests

### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-11 13:46]
  - **Task**: Add timestamp to reflection history template
  - **Objective**: Avoid merge conflicts when multiple reflections occur on the same day
  - **Outcome**: Updated AGENTS instructions and template to include date and time

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - Documentation change required minimal updates

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Running all checks still takes time even for small docs

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Provide a lightweight documentation-only workflow to skip heavy builds
### :book: Reflection for [2025-06-11 14:52]
  - **Task**: Adjust reflection formatting
  - **Objective**: Address reviewer comments to indent bullet lists and remove unnecessary tags
