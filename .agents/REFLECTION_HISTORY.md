## :memo: Reflection History
### :book: Reflection for 2025-06-10
  - **Task**: Update chat helpers documentation
  - **Objective**: Expand comments for message constructors and document `chatCompletionRequest` parameters.
  - **Outcome**: Added detailed doc comments and verified formatting, linting, tests, coverage and example builds.

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - Project tooling caught formatting issues automatically.

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Building all examples takes time due to compilation of dependencies.

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Provide pre-built artifacts or a cached dependencies layer to speed up example builds.

### :book: Reflection for 2025-06-10
  - **Task**: Add doc comments for configuration and API methods
  - **Objective**: Improve library documentation clarity
  - **Outcome**: Added detailed descriptions to methods and ensured tests pass

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - Tools made running formatter, linter and tests straightforward

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Building every example took a while due to dependency compilation

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Provide pre-built artifacts or caching for example builds to speed up CI

### :book: Reflection for 2025-06-11
  - **Task**: Document request helper functions
  - **Objective**: Clarify usage of helper constructors for OpenAI API requests
  - **Outcome**: Added Ddoc comments summarizing parameters and target endpoints

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - Prebuilt examples compiled successfully after changes

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Compiling each example manually is repetitive

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Provide a helper script to build all example projects in one step

### :book: Reflection for 2025-06-11
  - **Task**: Replace new `OpenAIClient` style
  - **Objective**: Match README style across examples
  - **Outcome**: Updated every example to use `new OpenAIClient()` and verified formatting, linting, tests, coverage, and builds.

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - Tooling automated formatting and linting effectively.

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Building each example individually remains slow.

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Add a script to build all examples in parallel.

### :book: Reflection for 2025-06-11
  - **Task**: Document reflection log guidelines
  - **Objective**: Prevent duplicate dates and maintain chronological order
  - **Outcome**: Updated AGENTS.md with instructions to deduplicate and append history properly

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - Simple documentation change required minimal code adjustments

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Running linter downloads dependencies each time, slowing down checks

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Cache linter dependencies to speed up future runs

### :book: Reflection for 2025-06-11
  - **Task**: Add example build script
  - **Objective**: Speed up building numerous example projects
  - **Outcome**: Created `scripts/build_examples.sh` with fast and all modes and documented its usage in AGENTS.md. Verified formatting, linting, tests, coverage and builds.

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - The helper script compiles selected examples with one command.

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Sequential example builds remain time-consuming and parallel builds caused dub cache conflicts.

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Investigate caching compiled dependencies or using `dub`'s built-in package cache to allow safe parallel builds.

### :book: Reflection for 2025-06-11
  - **Task**: Cache Dub packages in CI
  - **Objective**: Speed up continuous integration by avoiding repeated downloads
  - **Outcome**: Added actions/cache steps to store `~/.dub/packages` on Linux and Windows

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - Workflow configuration was straightforward to extend

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Cross-platform paths for Dub packages required extra attention

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Document recommended cache paths for different operating systems

### :book: Reflection for 2025-06-11 13:46
  - **Task**: Add timestamp to reflection history template
  - **Objective**: Avoid merge conflicts when multiple reflections occur on the same day
  - **Outcome**: Updated AGENTS instructions and template to include date and time

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - Documentation change required minimal updates

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Running all checks still takes time even for small docs

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Provide a lightweight documentation-only workflow to skip heavy builds
### :book: Reflection for 2025-06-11 14:52
  - **Task**: Adjust reflection formatting
  - **Objective**: Address reviewer comments to indent bullet lists and remove unnecessary tags
  - **Outcome**: Updated template and latest entry with proper list levels and cleaned tags

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - Small edits quickly satisfied the formatting guidelines

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Running full builds for doc-only changes is still slow

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Introduce a docs-only workflow to speed up checks

### :book: Reflection for 2025-06-12 10:54
  - **Task**: Fix reflection header levels
  - **Objective**: Clarify formatting blocks per reviewer comment
  - **Outcome**: Updated template and history entries to use consistent section levels

#### :sparkles: What went well
  - Simple regex replace corrected headings quickly

#### :warning: Pain points
  - Waiting for full build cycle just to edit documentation

#### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
  - Add a linter rule to validate reflection headings automatically
