## :memo: Reflection History
### :book: Reflection for 2025-06-10
- **Task**: Update chat helpers documentation
- **Objective**: Expand comments for message constructors and document `chatCompletionRequest` parameters.
- **Outcome**: Added detailed doc comments and verified formatting, linting, tests, coverage and example builds.

### :sparkles: What went well
- Project tooling caught formatting issues automatically.

### :warning: Pain points
- Building all examples takes time due to compilation of dependencies.

### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
- Provide pre-built artifacts or a cached dependencies layer to speed up example builds.

### :book: Reflection for 2025-06-10
- **Task**: Add doc comments for configuration and API methods
- **Objective**: Improve library documentation clarity
- **Outcome**: Added detailed descriptions to methods and ensured tests pass

### :sparkles: What went well
- Tools made running formatter, linter and tests straightforward

### :warning: Pain points
- Building every example took a while due to dependency compilation

### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
- Provide pre-built artifacts or caching for example builds to speed up CI

### :book: Reflection for 2025-06-11
- **Task**: Document request helper functions
- **Objective**: Clarify usage of helper constructors for OpenAI API requests
- **Outcome**: Added Ddoc comments summarizing parameters and target endpoints

### :sparkles: What went well
- Prebuilt examples compiled successfully after changes

### :warning: Pain points
- Compiling each example manually is repetitive

### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
- Provide a helper script to build all example projects in one step

### :book: Reflection for 2025-06-11
- **Task**: Replace new `OpenAIClient` style
- **Objective**: Match README style across examples
- **Outcome**: Updated every example to use `new OpenAIClient()` and verified formatting, linting, tests, coverage, and builds.

### :sparkles: What went well
- Tooling automated formatting and linting effectively.

### :warning: Pain points
- Building each example individually remains slow.

### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
- Add a script to build all examples in parallel.

### :book: Reflection for 2025-06-11
- **Task**: Document reflection log guidelines
- **Objective**: Prevent duplicate dates and maintain chronological order
- **Outcome**: Updated AGENTS.md with instructions to deduplicate and append history properly

### :sparkles: What went well
- Simple documentation change required minimal code adjustments

### :warning: Pain points
- Running linter downloads dependencies each time, slowing down checks

### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
- Cache linter dependencies to speed up future runs

### :book: Reflection for 2025-06-11
- **Task**: Add example build script
- **Objective**: Speed up building numerous example projects
- **Outcome**: Created `scripts/build_examples.sh` with fast and all modes and documented its usage in AGENTS.md. Verified formatting, linting, tests, coverage and builds.

### :sparkles: What went well
- The helper script compiles selected examples with one command.

### :warning: Pain points
- Sequential example builds remain time-consuming and parallel builds caused dub cache conflicts.

### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
- Investigate caching compiled dependencies or using `dub`'s built-in package cache to allow safe parallel builds.

### :book: Reflection for 2025-06-11
- **Task**: Cache Dub packages in CI
- **Objective**: Speed up continuous integration by avoiding repeated downloads
- **Outcome**: Added actions/cache steps to store `~/.dub/packages` on Linux and Windows

### :sparkles: What went well
- Workflow configuration was straightforward to extend

### :warning: Pain points
- Cross-platform paths for Dub packages required extra attention

### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
- Document recommended cache paths for different operating systems

### :book: Reflection for 2025-06-12
- **Task**: Make metadata optional in responses
- **Objective**: Ensure API structs support optional metadata fields
- **Outcome**: Added `@serdeOptional` attribute, updated formatting, linting, tests, coverage and example builds

### :sparkles: What went well
- Toolchain handled formatting and building examples reliably

### :warning: Pain points
- Coverage files clutter the repo root and are hard to review

### :bulb: Proposed Improvement
- Provide a script to summarize coverage results and clean up old lst files
